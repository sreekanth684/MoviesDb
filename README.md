# MoviesDb
MoviesDb Android App
Would need the property "MyMoviesDbApiKey" for making api calls. 
The app will make a api call once per day to get the latest movies. 
It stores movies, movieDetails(info,trailers,reviews) & favoriteMovies in data-base.
After accessing any detail for the first time everything can be accessed with wifi turned off from dB!
SignedAPK(app-release.apk) included in app folder
